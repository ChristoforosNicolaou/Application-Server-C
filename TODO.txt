HTTP/1.1 Only

Implement Messages/Parsing:
GET -> respond with file contents. if file is python or php execute and return output
HEAD -> Only return server header
DELETE -> Return header & delete file from directory
POST -> Must check RFC2616 response
Others -> Not Implemented

Client request:
GET /sample.html HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: My_web_browser (IGNORE LINE)
Host: host:30000 (I think IGNORE LINE)
Connection: keep-alive (or close)

Server response:
1 line response (see below)
Header lines (Server, Connection, Content-Type, Content-Length)
1 Empty Line
1 Data

Server responses:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
HTTP/1.1 501 Not Implemented

On Server:
*Ignore all other headers
While Connection != close
	receive request
	response with Connection: keep-alive
else send response with Connetion: close

Thread pool

Configuration file with:
THREADS (num threads in pool)
PORT (server port e.g. 30000)
HOME (server home directory)
Maybe also SERVER name (for header response)

Additional:
Code must have unit test files!!!
README.txt -> Instructions (1 page)
Architecture (doc/pdf) -> System architecture, extra functionalities, difficulties (2-3 pages)
